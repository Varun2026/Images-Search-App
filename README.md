# Images-Search-App
This web app is made using HTML, CSS, JS and a Public API. I used Unsplash's Public API to create my own "Google" for Images. Here, Any Images can be searched to see. It is responsive for both Web view and Mobile view.
Here's the link for the web app: https://images-search-app-rhz5.vercel.app/
